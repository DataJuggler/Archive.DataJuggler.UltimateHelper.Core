# DataJuggler.UltimateHelper.Core
This is a port of DataJuggler.Core.UltimateHelper to Dot Net Core 3 (preview). I am as confused by the names as you are, but DataJuggler.Core.UltimateHelper was created in 2012, before Dot Net Core even existed.

For now I am just porting a subset of classes I need to publish my Blazor website.

More classes from the Dot Net Framework project DataJuggler.Core.UltimateHelper will be ported to this Dot Net Core library as I have time.
